# This PC Cleanup

This little registry file removes Desktop, Documents Downloads, Music, Pictures and Videos from This PC.

Links to these folders was added automatically in Windows 8.1, with the only way to remove them being through the Registry. I really didn't like having folders there so I wanted to make an easy way of removing them, as I can't be the only one to dislike this decision.

I've also included a backup of the NameSpaces key, incase you do want the folders there.
