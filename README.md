# This PC Cleanup

This little registry file removes the links to Desktop, Documents Downloads, Music, Pictures and Videos from This PC.

Links to these folders was added automatically in Windows 8.1, and the only way to remove them is through the Registry. I found that incredibly annoying so I went around and found the information to make this quick little script to remove them.

I was really hoping for a way to only have one path for all the keys, but I didn't find anything. Please submit a pull request if you know how!
