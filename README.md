Double click `cleanup.reg` to remove the links to Desktop, Documents, Downloads, Music, Pictures and Videos under This PC.

These folders were added automatically in Windows 8.1 and the only way to remove them is through the Registry. I can't be the only one to dislike the decision to have those folders added there, so I made a little .reg file to remove them easily.

I've also included a backup of the NameSpaces key, incase you do want the folders there.
